# Now you can contribute more easily to crowdin

To have a better experience with your language!

The repositories are already configured to translate to a certain language. 
If you want to collaborate with crowdin, follow these steps:

1. Check the corresponding value folder with your language:

Example: Brazilian (values-pt-rBR) | German: (values-de)

2. Check the filename of the string you want to translate:

Example: https://github.com/ArrowOS-Extended/android_packages_apps_Settings/blob/arrow-13.1/res/values/arrow_strings.xml

To translate the configuration functions into your language, you need to create the arrow_strings.xml file inside the value folder for your language.

3. After that, place it in the res folder, in the folder you want to translate, such as Settings or GameSpace. 

By doing all these steps, you can make a pull request, or [contact me](https://t.me/Vhmit) so I can include the translation.
